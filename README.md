# PokeGo-Slave
Yet another Pokemon Go bot, built using Node.js and express.js to serve the web client UI.

# Disclaimer
This is created for educational purpose. I use this project to uderstand the underlying method of data trasfer used in games. Specifically data enveloping methods.
I also use this to learn my understanding about automation process.
Use it as you see fit. I do not held any responsibility of this project usage.

# How to use
## Prerequisites:
1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.
2. Clone this project.
3. Navigate to it's root directory.
4. Run 'npm install' to install depencencies.

## Usage:
1. Edit ./bot/Settings.json as you see fit. The guide are bellow this section. 
2. Run 'node /bin/www' to run the bot. You can navigate to 'http://localhost:3000/' to see the GUI report.
3. Or better yet, just run './start' on *nix platforms or 'start.bat' on Windows.

## Settings
Here are the settings' explanation:
- username : This is your username. Either PTC or Google account.
- password : Your password. For Google account who activated multi-factor authentication, create app password. How? Ask Google.. :3
- provider : Your account provider. This should be "google" or "ptc".
- centerType : The type center of your operation coverage. Can be "coords" for lat-long coordinate, or "name" for named places like "Central Park" for example.
- centerName : Fill your center location name, e.g: "Central Park". You can omit or use empty string if your type is "coords".
- centerLatitude : Your center's latitude.
- centerLongitude : Your center's longitude.
- radius : Your operation radius. Your character will not walking outside of this circle.
- loopInterval: Your operation interval in milliseconds. 4000 should be safe for now. Less than that, I'm pretty sure they will throttle you.
- autoCleanPokemon: Define whether you want to clean your pokemon storage by transferring duplicates.
- pokemonKeepNumber: Number of pokemon you want to keep in your storage. i.e: if you set it to 3, then you'll have at least 3 pidgie after purging them.
- pokemonKeepSpecific: Exceptions for keep number. Pokemon listed here will have individual keep number.
- step: Your character step distance in meter. Note that this is related with the loop interval. In the default value, this means 10 meter for 4 seconds (a.k.a 2.5m/s).
- ball: Your ball to use. 1 = Pokeball, 2 = Great Ball, 3 = Ultra Ball, 4 = Master Ball.
- movement: Your character movement. For now, it support "none", if you want your character standstill, and "random" for random destination walks.
- collect: Define whether you want to collect items from PokeStop. true = collect, false = ignore the pokestop.
- encounter: Same with collect, but for wild pokemons. true = catch, false = let them be.
- target: Your catch target preference. Supporting "all" for catch all of them, "except" for catch all except for the one specified, "only" for catch only specified pokemons.
- specificTargets: List of pokemon's name for target.

That's it. :3

# TODO:
## Checklist
- [X] Auto-walk using random coordinate to hatch eggs
- [X] Catch Nearby Pokemon automatically
- [X] Use Normal/Super/Great Pokeballs... (need a rework to cascade usages)
- [X] Display Avatar on map
- [X] Display Avatar's destination on map
- [X] Update Avatar position when walking
- [X] Display pokestops on map. Including active lure and collected state (purple color)
- [X] Display gyms on map
- [X] Display catchable pokemon on map
- [X] Pokemon automatic transfer (user can limit number of possession. Pokemon with lowest CP will be transfered first)
- [X] Pokemon catch filter. Can be 'all', 'except', or 'only'
- [X] Incubate eggs
- [X] Sort owned pokemons based on # on pokedex, name, or CP.
- [ ] Enable/disable auto-walk from UI
- [ ] Double click map to set trainer location.
- [ ] Drop items when bag is full. I think this should be done manually from UI.

## Considered, but not primary target
- [ ] Evolve pokemon
- [ ] Use candy

# Additional information (deprecated)
Update: I don't use native codes for now (both s2-geometry and u6 implementation is pure javascript). This repo should be platform agnostic for the time being.

Regarding s2geometry-node issue (specially in Windows), just make sure you have install the build tools at the link above. 
If your still have error on building it, try update your npm with 'npm install -g npm@next' with Administrator credentials.
